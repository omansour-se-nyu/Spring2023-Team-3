# Spring2023-Team-3
This is team repository for Team 3 (Spring 2023)

The MentCare project allows medical staff at a mental hospital to store information about mentally ill patients in a remote database. The frontend of the app consists of several python files. If you run the login.py file, you will be prompted for a username and password. If you don't have an account, you can click register to register for a new user account. Once you login, you will be able to create new patient records. In the future, we plan to allow users to edit patient records and find existing records in the database. We also plan to provide different privileges for each type of user account (doctor, hospital admin, etc). In addition, we will create a notification service to enable medical staff to respond to an at risk patient. Staff will be able to store treatment information with our app and help mentally ill patients recover.
